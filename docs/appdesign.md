# Explore the app design cycle

![app-design-cycle](./assets/app-design--design-cycle.png)

[Discovery](#discovery---ask-questions): talk to people to understand the problem. Ideas based on user feedback. Organize features into simple sketches.  
**Prototypes**: simple, testable versions. Often with no code. Interactive screens (more complex than sketches, less than full app). Used to explore different approaches.  
**Validation**: test with users to validate work and check if solves the problem. Observe interaction with the product, interpret the results to determine features that need rework.  
**Iteration**: Take insights and refine ideas and prototypes.

# Discovery - Ask questions
Talk to people. Look for patterns in the challenges they face and identify opportunities. 
(Tutorial uses an example app for people to capture moments of gratitude. Design principles still apply to different apps).

## Section 1 - Talk to people
How can you help people reach a goal? (Design question). What goals they have. What helps, what hinders them.  
Refine initial idea by talking to people. Emotions, challenges, unmet needs help shape app direction.

#### Step 1
Talk to someone you know how they keep up with habits. Their process. Take notes on what habit they mention, tool they use, if any, how often. Joys and struggles.  
(For a different app ask open-ended questions that fit your theme).    

#### Step 2
Write 2/3 insights. Try to identify unmet needs, friction points.   
Example:  
“She records her workouts in Notes. She often forgets unless she already has the app open.”  
“He uses alarms so he doesn’t forget. He wants it to feel more fun, not like a to-do.”

## Section 2 - Look for patterns
Gather observations related to how you want to help. Look for patterns in responses.  
Emotional points are powerful motivators you can tap into making the app useful and compelling.  

#### Step 1 
Talk to more people who might use the app your designing. Ask open-ended questions about their needs, goals and experiences. Not just what they say, how they say it.  
"What would you like this activity to feel like?"  
"Tell me about other tools you used in the past to help."  

#### Step 2
Highlight ideas and themes that repeat in the notes. Group similar ideas, emotions and problems. What do they care about? Where they get stuck?

#### Step 3
Write clear insights from patterns. Use to spot opportunities to improve the app. Start with just 2/3.  
Collect more feedback to find more patterns.  

## Section 3 - Do it yourself
Reflect on your own experience.

#### Step 1
Pick a habit your app might support. Try it. What feels easy or enjoyable? What feels harder or frustrating? 

#### Step 2 
How did that feel? Easy or awkward? Anything felt motivating or frustrating? What suprised you? What got in your way? 

#### Step 3
What would make me want to do this again? How the app can boost motivation? How can it ease frustration? What kind of tone or guidance might help?  
This helps the tool feel warm and empathetic.  

Start with people and their goals to guide your design choices.

# Discovery - Organize your features
Identify essential features to define its structure. Decide how to organize them and plan how people navigate through the app.  

An app structure guides how people find their way, highlights important features, shapes experience from first interaction.

## Section 1 - Define what is essential to your app
The list of features grows quickly. Focus on what is critical. Focus on the app's purpose to decide what it truly needs.  
When, where and how people will use it? What will help? What will get in the way? Focusing on essentials makes the app easier to navigate and more empowering.

#### Step 1
Write down every feature.

#### Step 2
Choose essential features and set the rest aside.  
Example:  
For an app that encourages a habit of being grateful one feature that is critical might be adding an entry — details about a time the user felt greatful.

#### Step 3
For each essential feature, write ideas for how to bring it into the app.

#### Step 4
Identify steps for each feature. Set aside what feels distracting, repetitive or unclear.

## Section 2 - Group related features
People want to move through the app with confidence that features would be in logical places.  
Group related features together. Think in terms of spaces or sections. 

#### Step 1
List essential features (physical or digital notes). Include actions or elments of each on its note.  
(You should be able to move them around).

#### Step 2 
Move notes until related features feel naturally grouped together.  
This sets the stage to create screens and navigation.  
Example:  
Viewing past entries and recording new entries form a group, because they’re both focused on the user’s entries. User settings and in-app achievements wouldn’t be part of that group.

#### Step 3
Label each group with a simple, clear name.

## Section 3 - Sketch your screens
Turn notes to sketches to map both screens and flow between them. Decide key screens and how people will navigate using iOS components (tab bar, toolbar).

#### Step 1
Sketch screens based on essential features. Draw boxes for images or media, gray bars for text. Size based on importance. Leave space to note the intention for each screen to help with the flow.  
Many of the essential features will have their own screens. When grouping features keep screens focused (easy to understand).

#### Step 2
Review sketches, decide which screens deserve a tab. Tabs represent main app destinations — what users will visit more often. Add tab bars to the sketched screens.  
Would someone access this area frequently? If so it likely deserves a tab.  
Note:  
Tab bar is the best way to reach main sections. Always visible and easy to access. Keep 3 to 5 at most. It is for navigation, not actions.  

#### Step 3
For each screen, think about the main action people will take. Besides navigating to another tab, decide whether the screen should have a toolbar (1/2 essential actions). Add toolbars to sketched screens. Include a clear title that names current screen and actions people are most likely to use in that context.  
Note:
Toolbar sits at the top. Orients people with clear title. Provides important actions. Includes: back/forward navigation (not on iOS 26), search (not on iOS 26), add/cancel buttons (not on iOS 26), menus of commands people use frequently.

#### Step 4
Trace a journey through the actions. Do you know where you are at each step? Is the next step obvious?  
(It should aim to feel predictable without explanation. If not repeat sketch process).

## Section 4 - Understand structure and navigation
[Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines) - Best practices to design great experience. Emphasize hierarchy, harmony, and consistency.  
When users instantly know where they are, what they can do, where they can go next, the app feels effortless. This makes users come back.   
Clear structure. Features grouped intuitively in purposeful screens. Navigation anchored by the right use of tab bar and toolbar.  

The tab bar provides navigation to your app’s main screens. Keep your tab bar focused, and remember that it’s only for navigation, not actions.

# Discovery - Wrap-up: Discovery

## Reflect on the design principles
Effective designs start with clarity. This chapter is about refining an app's purpose. Who is it for and organizing navigation so it feels intuitive.  
Test assumptions by talking to people. What they say, how they say it. Spotting patterns. Motives or overwhelming factors.  
Defining an essential feature list. Grouping screens by function. Simplifying user experience.  
This creates a strong foundation for the design.  

### Topics and skills covered 
* Identifying opportunities and defining a clear purpose
* Talking to people and identifying behaviour patterns
* Refining an idea focusing on essential features
* Organizing features into logical screen groups
* Structuring the app using tab bar and toolbars
* Creating screen Sketches 

## Continue practicing

### Extend your design
1. Show sketches to someone and ask what they expect the screen to do. Attention to where your intentions need clarification. 
2. Revisit navigation structure. Anything redundant, unnecessary? Try combining and removing items, see how it changes overall experience, does it still works?

### Challenge yourself 
Add more ideas. Sketch additional screens, alternate versions of the main screen or flows for onboarding, confirmation, error states. Consider edge cases.
